White hat SEO and black hat SEO are two different approaches to search engine optimization (SEO) that aim to improve a website's search engine rankings.

White hat SEO refers to ethical and legitimate SEO tactics that abide by search engine guidelines and aim to provide valuable and relevant content to users. Examples of white hat SEO include creating high-quality content, optimizing website structure and navigation, using descriptive and relevant meta tags, building quality backlinks, and using keywords naturally and strategically.

Black hat SEO, on the other hand, refers to unethical and illegitimate SEO tactics that violate search engine guidelines to manipulate rankings. Examples of black hat SEO include keyword stuffing, cloaking, hidden text, link farming, and buying links or fake reviews.

While black hat SEO may achieve short-term gains in search engine rankings, it can lead to severe penalties, such as being banned from search engines altogether. Therefore, white hat SEO is generally the preferred approach for long-term and sustainable success in search engine rankings.
